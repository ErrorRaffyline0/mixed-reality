# Immersive Shopping Experiences

Consumers are always seeking new ways to get their shopping done faster and more efficiently. Businesses are finding new ways to better enable them by utilizing the power of virtual reality. By tapping into the strengths of what virtual reality experiences can do for consumers, businesses can significantly cut down on physical infrastructure and storefront costs while heavily increasing accessibility to product and service offerings for potential customers.
 
## Immersive shopping in VR: What it is and how it works

Virtual reality has enabled enterprises and businesses to create the next level of digital shopping experiences for their customers. By developing fully immersive storefronts and product experiences, companies are better enabling their customers to directly see and interact with products or learn more about services and offerings within the realm of virtual space.

## Setting up, deploying, and managing immersive shopping experiences

### What solutions does the Windows Mixed Reality platform have to assist with configuring virtual play spaces for use with immersive shopping experiences?

Many VR experiences require setting up a play space to use them safely. Play spaces are designated real-world spaces that have been cleared of obstacles and deemed safe to use VR in, corresponding to the playerâ€™s location in virtual space to prevent them from colliding with anything in the real world. For guidance on setting up simple room boundaries up to 5mx5m, see the [set up your room boundary](set-up-windows-mixed-reality.md#set-up-your-room-boundary) documentation. For guidance on setting up larger and more complex play spaces by utilizing the Spatial Anchors capability in the Windows Holographic API stack, visit the [coordinate systems](/windows/mixed-reality/design/coordinate-systems) documentation.
 
### How can the Windows Mixed Reality platform and Azure Cloud Services assist with managing and deploying immersive shopping experiences? 

Azure-based onsite and remote management can help your business scale your immersive shopping experiences. Visit the [Cloud Services & Azure FAQ](enterprise-lbe-faq.md#cloud-services--azure-faq) to learn more.
