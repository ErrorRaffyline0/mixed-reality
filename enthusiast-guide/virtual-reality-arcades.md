# Virtual Reality Arcades 

More retail customers are progressively adopting Virtual Reality, even though virtual reality is still cost-prohibitive for some people to consider purchasing their own at-home VR devices. Businesses have found great success by tapping into this trend and providing the service of low-barrier access to VR. People can come and rent out SteamVR-capable kiosks or booths through arcade-style spaces to try out the latest and greatest virtual reality games and experiences available today.  

## Virtual reality arcades: What they are and how they work

Virtual reality arcade businesses succeed by providing customers low-barrier access to higher-end virtual reality technology, devices, and experiences without the upfront cost of purchasing these components to own at home.

There are currently several Windows Mixed Reality-compatible devices and accessories available to assist with building out premier VR arcade establishments. The Windows Mixed Reality platform streamlines set up and connects directly to Steam, where users can access the expansive library of SteamVR titles.

## Setting up, deploying, and managing SteamVR kiosks or booths in virtual reality arcades.

### What solutions does the Windows Mixed Reality platform have to assist with configuring virtual play spaces for SteamVR kiosks or booths in virtual reality arcades?

Many VR experiences require setting up a play space to use them safely. Play spaces are designated real-world spaces that have been cleared of obstacles and deemed safe to use VR in, corresponding to the playerâ€™s location in virtual space to prevent them from colliding with anything in the real world. For guidance on setting up simple room boundaries up to 5mx5m, see the [set up your room boundary](set-up-windows-mixed-reality.md#set-up-your-room-boundary) documentation. For guidance on setting up larger and more complex play spaces by utilizing the Spatial Anchors capability in the Windows Holographic API stack, visit the [coordinate systems](/windows/mixed-reality/design/coordinate-systems) documentation.  
 
### How can the Windows Mixed Reality platform and Azure Cloud Services assist with managing and deploying SteamVR kiosks or booths in virtual reality arcades?

Azure-based onsite and remote management can help your business scale your SteamVR kiosks or booths in virtual reality arcades. Visit the [Cloud Services & Azure FAQ](enterprise-lbe-faq.md#cloud-services--azure-faq) to learn more.
