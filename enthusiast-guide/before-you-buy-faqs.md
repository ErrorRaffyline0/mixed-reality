### Where can I buy standalone motion controllers

**Quick Answer:** Unfortunately, we're not aware of any retailers selling standalone motion controllers at this time.

### What is the difference between a Windows Mixed Reality PC and a Windows Mixed Reality Ultra PC

**Quick Answer:** Details about Windows Mixed Reality PCs and Ultra PCs are captured here: <https://aka.ms/mrcompat>

### Why is this called Windows "Mixed Reality" when the devices look like they provide a "Virtual Reality" experience

**Quick Answer:** Mixed Reality refers to the full spectrum of spatial computing, from augmented reality and holograms to virtual reality. Windows Mixed Reality platform supports devices across Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). We currently support two device types with similar technology on that spectrum: HoloLens (AR) and Windows Mixed Reality (VR) headsets with motion controllers.

### What is the difference between Windows Mixed Reality and other VR headsets

**Quick Answer:** Windows Mixed Reality headsets feature inside-out tracking (tracking cameras are in the headset) and plug-and-play setup with Windows 10 and Windows 11.

**More detail**: Windows Mixed Reality offers several features, including easy setup (no need for external sensors to track you and your controllers), your choice of headsets to meet your comfort and price-point, headsets that have competitive resolutions, and finally a unique user experience that features a spatial interface, which allows you to use thousands of apps from the Microsoft Store.

### Does Mixed Reality mean that inside-out cameras are passthrough? Can you experience Augmented Reality in addition to Virtual Reality

**Quick Answer:** No, the inside-out cameras on Windows Mixed Reality headsets are used for positional tracking only. Windows Mixed Reality headsets are occluded, meaning that they are for Virtual Reality and don't provide a view of the real world or Augmented Reality.

### What is inside-out tracking? How is it different than outside-in tracking or lighthouse tracking

* **Inside-out tracking** Windows Mixed Reality, Oculus Quest, and Vive/Index systems use inside-out tracking. With inside-out tracking cameras are built into the headset and track changes in the environment to determine the headset's position based on the environment as you move around. Some systems, such as the HTC Vive and Valve Index, use infrared sensors instead of cameras and depend on external "lighthouses" or "base stations" that project infrared light to track their environment.

* **Outside-in tracking** Systems such as the Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR use outside-in tracking.  With outside-in tracking, the headset is tracked by one or more external devices. Camera(s) are built into those external devices, placed around the environment and are used to determine the position of the headset based on the environment.

Find out more about [inside-out tracking](./tracking-system.md).

### Can inside-out tracking of motion controllers impact my game play due to camera FOV

 Like the headsets, the Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers require no setup of external tracking sensors. Instead, the controllers are tracked by sensors in the headset itself. If the user moves the controllers out of the headset's field of view, in most cases Windows will continue to infer controller positions and provide them to the app. When the controller has lost visual tracking for long enough, the controller's positions will drop to approximate-accuracy positions. At this point, the system will body-lock the controller to the user, tracking the user's position as they move around, while still exposing the controller's true orientation using its internal orientation sensors. Many apps that use controllers to point at and activate UI elements can operate normally while in approximate accuracy without the user even noticing. The best way to get a feel for this is to try it yourself.

### How is Windows Mixed Reality different from Samsung Gear VR

**Quick Answer:** All smartphone-based VR products, including the Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream, use three Degrees Of Freedom (3DOF) head position tracking systems. 3DOF based systems allow you to move your head **only** from the neck up in the virtual world. Windows MR on the other hand uses a six Degrees of Freedom (6DOF) head and controllers position tracking systems. 6DOF based systems allow you to move your entire body in the virtual world; so you can walk around an object and see it from different perspectives, just like you can in the physical world. The Rift and the Vive are also 6DOF based systems.
