# Location-Based Entertainment with Windows Mixed Reality

In the last couple of years, we've seen incredible growth and innovation in the enterprise and location-based entertainment (LBE) spaces as countless virtual entertainment experiences and business solutions continue to push the envelope for what is possible utilizing virtual reality technologies.

Traditional venues like theme parks, theaters, and other family entertainment centers have been finding remarkable success by introducing immersive virtual reality games and experiences, as both spotlight marquee attractions and complementary entertainment offerings for existing rides and installations.
