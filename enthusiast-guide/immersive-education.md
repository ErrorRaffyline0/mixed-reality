# Immersive Education

Education institutions have found a range of implementations for virtual reality technologies within their schools. Immersive education is one of the fastest-growing technology-enhanced learning (TEL) components. VR has proven to help educators better contextualize their curriculum by immersing students in experiences that bring various study subjects to life in new and exciting ways. 

## Immersive education in VR: What it is and how it works

Virtual reality is about bringing the user closer to their virtual experiences. Applying these same principles in education has proven to be a powerful tool for instructors, teachers, and educators. 
Educational experiences built for virtual reality allow students to virtually walk through the pages of history books, create and build virtual works of art, safely explore the powers and consequences of the sciences, and explore the broader world around us through the display of their virtual reality headset.

## Designing and developing immersive education experiences

### What resources does the Windows Mixed Reality platform have to assist with designing and developing immersive education experiences?

The Mixed Reality Docs hub contains several pages covering different components of the design and development process for building immersive education experiences. Visit the [Design and development FAQ](enterprise-lbe-faq.md#design-and-development-faq) to learn more.

### What resources does the Windows Mixed Reality platform have to assist with building immersive education experiences that can host multiple students in one session?

The Mixed Reality Docs hub contains several pages covering the information needed for building immersive education experiences capable of hosting multiple students at once. Visit the [Multiuser FAQ](enterprise-lbe-faq.md#multiuser-faq) to learn more.

## Setting up, deploying, and managing immersive education experiences

### What solutions does the Windows Mixed Reality platform have to assist with configuring virtual play spaces for immersive education experiences?

Many VR experiences require setting up of a play space to use them safely. Play spaces are designated real-world spaces that have been cleared of obstacles and deemed safe to use VR in, corresponding to the playerâ€™s location in virtual space to prevent them from colliding with anything in the real world. For guidance on setting up simple room boundaries up to 5mx5m, see the [set up your room boundary](set-up-windows-mixed-reality.md#set-up-your-room-boundary) documentation. For guidance on setting up larger and more complex play spaces by utilizing the Spatial Anchors capability in the Windows Holographic API stack, visit the [coordinate systems](/windows/mixed-reality/design/coordinate-systems) documentation.  
 
### How can the Windows Mixed Reality platform and Azure Cloud Services help managing and deploying immersive education experiences?

Azure-based onsite and remote management can help your business scale your immersive education experiences. Visit the [Cloud Services & Azure FAQ](enterprise-lbe-faq.md#cloud-services--azure-faq) to learn more.
