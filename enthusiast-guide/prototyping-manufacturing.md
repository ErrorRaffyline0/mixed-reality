# Prototyping and manufacturing for enterprises

Businesses have been finding applications for virtual reality in the prototyping and manufacturing spaces. By utilizing virtual prototyping, companies have reduced design and alteration costs associated with individual project components to full-scale product designs. Similarly, leaders in the manufacturing space have found virtual reality to be especially valuable when examining production lines for potential hazards or risks.  

## Prototyping and manufacturing in VR: What it is and how it works 

Costs associated with prototyping and manufacturing at an enterprise scale can become high quickly. The introduction of virtual reality elements into these spaces can significantly reduce project spending to ensure quality designs and help to build safe and secure production lines. 

Using VR for prototyping can significantly increase the speed of production processes. By moving design and prototyping into virtual space, businesses can remove the need to produce costly physical prototypes and more easily iterate on designs rapidly. Implementing virtual reality can significantly improve manufacturing precision, safety, and security. Infrastructure stability, worker safety, and product quality are just a few areas in which businesses have seen significant improvements by introducing virtual reality technology into their workspaces and workflows. 

## Virtual training for manufacturing scenarios in VR 

### What resources does the Windows Mixed Reality platform have to assist with virtual training for manufacturing scenarios? 

Businesses often benefit from virtually training new hires for potentially hazardous systems, equipment, and processes without directly exposing them to the risks of these scenarios in the real world. Learn more by visiting the [training and simulation](training-simulation.md) page.

## Designing and developing immersive manufacturing and prototyping experiences  

### What resources does the Windows Mixed Reality platform have to assist with designing and developing immersive prototyping and manufacturing experiences?

The Mixed Reality Docs hub contains several pages covering different components of the design and development process for building immersive prototyping and manufacturing experiences. Visit the [Design and development FAQ](enterprise-lbe-faq.md#design-and-development-faq) to learn more.

### What resources does the Windows Mixed Reality platform have to assist with building immersive prototyping and manufacturing experiences that are capable of hosting multiple users in one session?

The Mixed Reality Docs hub contains several pages covering the information needed for building immersive prototyping and manufacturing experiences capable of hosting multiple users at once. Visit the [Multiuser FAQ](enterprise-lbe-faq.md#multiuser-faq) to learn more.
 
## Setting up, deploying, and managing immersive prototyping and manufacturing experiences.

### What solutions does the Windows Mixed Reality platform have to assist with configuring virtual play spaces for use with immersive prototyping and manufacturing experiences? 

Many VR experiences require setting up a play space to use them safely. Play spaces are designated real-world spaces that have been cleared of obstacles and deemed safe to use VR in, corresponding to the playerâ€™s location in virtual space to prevent them from colliding with anything in the real world. For guidance on setting up simple room boundaries up to 5mx5m, see the [set up your room boundary](set-up-windows-mixed-reality.md#set-up-your-room-boundary) documentation. For guidance on setting up larger and more complex play spaces by utilizing the Spatial Anchors capability in the Windows Holographic API stack, visit the [coordinate systems](/windows/mixed-reality/design/coordinate-systems) documentation.  

### How can the Windows Mixed Reality platform and Azure Cloud Services help managing and deploying immersive prototyping and manufacturing experiences? 

A: Azure-based onsite and remote management can help your business scale your immersive prototyping and manufacturing experiences. Visit the [Cloud Services & Azure FAQ](enterprise-lbe-faq.md#cloud-services--azure-faq) to learn more.
