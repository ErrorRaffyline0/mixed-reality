# Training and simulation for enterprises

Enterprises and businesses are constantly finding new opportunities to apply virtual reality technologies to improve the capabilities of their workforce. The Windows Mixed Reality platform can assist with designing, developing, and deploying immersive training and simulation experiences at scale.

## Immersive training and simulation: What it is and how it works 

Humans often learn best through hands-on learning. Allowing trainees to practice potentially hazardous scenarios in virtual space is an opportunity for them to receive quality feedback in real-time on any potential mistakes or errors they might make while learning.  

Immersive training and simulation solutions are often most effective when harnessing the combined strengths of human perception and virtual reality computing to generate compelling learning experiences in virtual space. By utilizing virtual teaching elements to immerse the wearer into potentially dangerous on-the-job situations, trainees can be removed from the potential for personal harm or injury while avoiding the risk of costly failure instances to other personnel and or infrastructure around them. 

## Designing and developing immersive training and simulation experiences  

### What resources does the Windows Mixed Reality platform have to assist with designing and developing immersive training or simulation experiences? 

The Mixed Reality Docs hub contains several pages covering different components of the design and development process for building professional and informative immersive training and simulation experiences. Visit the [Design and development FAQ](enterprise-lbe-faq.md#design-and-development-faq) to learn more.

### What resources does the Windows Mixed Reality platform have to assist with building immersive training or simulation experiences that can host multiple users in one session? 

The Mixed Reality Docs hub contains several pages covering the information needed for building immersive training and simulation experiences capable of hosting multiple users at once. Visit the [Multiuser FAQ](enterprise-lbe-faq.md#multiuser-faq) to learn more.

## Setting up, deploying, and managing immersive training and simulation experiences.

### What solutions does the Windows Mixed Reality platform have to assist with configuring virtual play spaces and setting up multi-user immersive training or simulation experiences? 

Many VR experiences require setting up a play space to use them safely. Play spaces are designated real-world spaces that have been cleared of obstacles and deemed safe to use VR in, corresponding to the playerâ€™s location in virtual space to prevent them from colliding with anything in the real world. Guidance on setting up simple room boundaries up to 5mx5m can be found in the [Set up your room boundary](set-up-windows-mixed-reality.md#set-up-your-room-boundary) documentation. Visit the [Coordinate systems documentation](/windows/mixed-reality/design/coordinate-systems) for guidance on setting up larger and more complex play spaces by utilizing the Spatial Anchors capability in the Windows Holographic API stack.  

Suppose an immersive training or simulation experience will host [multiple users within the same session](enterprise-lbe-faq.md#multiuser-faq). In this case, you can use the [Map Manager](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/advanced-concepts/using-the-windows-device-portal#map-manager) interface in the Windows Device Portal for deployment and map sharing.

### How can the Windows Mixed Reality platform and Azure Cloud Services assist with managing and deploying immersive training or simulation experiences? 

Azure-based onsite and remote management can help your business scale your immersive training and simulation experiences. Visit the [Cloud Services & Azure FAQ](enterprise-lbe-faq.md#cloud-services--azure-faq) to learn more.
