# Theme Parks & Family Entertainment Centers 

Virtual reality experiences have become trendy additions to the robust entertainment offerings in spaces like theme parks and family entertainment centers (FECs). Businesses continue to implement increasingly attractive VR offerings into these scenarios. They range from stand-alone booths that allow customers to easily tap into the enormous content catalog of SteamVR to custom virtual reality experiences engineered to host multiple users in one unified experience all at one time.

## VR for theme parks and FECs: What it is and how it works

Popular family-friendly attractions like theme parks and other types of FECs are constantly seeking to introduce the latest and greatest entertainment experiences into their offerings. There's nothing available today that is more cutting-edge than virtual reality.

Virtual Reality experiences bring people closer to their entertainment by immersing them in unique and exciting virtual worlds. Spaces like theme parks and other large-scale FECs have found great success in modernizing their existing arcade spaces by introducing virtual reality. Kiosks allow them to leverage the expansive SteamVR content catalog. Others have been investing more heavily into virtual reality by commissioning custom-built VR experiences to deploy in their parks and FEC spaces, often leveraging popular brands and IP to achieve maximum interest among their customers.

## Setting up, deploying, and managing immersive experiences for theme parks and FECs. 

### What solutions does the Windows Mixed Reality platform have to assist with configuring virtual play spaces in immersive experiences scaled for theme parks and FECs? 

Many VR experiences require setting up a play space to use them safely. Play spaces are designated real-world spaces that have been cleared of obstacles and deemed safe to use VR in, corresponding to the playerâ€™s location in virtual space to prevent them from colliding with anything in the real world. For guidance on setting up simple room boundaries up to 5mx5m, see the [set up your room boundary](set-up-windows-mixed-reality.md#set-up-your-room-boundary) documentation. For guidance on setting up larger and more complex play spaces by utilizing the Spatial Anchors capability in the Windows Holographic API stack, visit the [coordinate systems](/windows/mixed-reality/design/coordinate-systems) documentation.  
 
### How can the Windows Mixed Reality platform and Azure Cloud Services assist with managing and deploying immersive experiences for theme parks and FECs? 

Azure-based onsite and remote management can help your business scale your immersive experiences for theme parks and FECs. Visit the [Cloud Services & Azure FAQ](enterprise-lbe-faq.md#cloud-services--azure-faq) to learn more.
