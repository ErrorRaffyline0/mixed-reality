For general Windows Mixed Reality Portal issues or **Something went wrong** errors, first try restarting Windows Mixed Reality:

  1. Select **Settings**  > **Mixed reality** > **Uninstall**.
  1. Select **Settings**  > **Devices**  > **Bluetooth & other devices** to unpair your motion controllers. Select each controller, and then select **Remove device**.
  1. Plug your headset back into your PC, and reinstall Windows Mixed Reality.

If you get a **Check your display cable** error message, try the following steps to troubleshoot the issue:

- Make sure to connect your headset to a DisplayPort 1.2 or later, or HDMI 1.4 or later.
- Make sure the connected port corresponds with the most advanced graphics card on your PC.
- If you're using an adapter, make sure the adapter is 4K capable.
