# Virtual Museums, Exhibits, & Tourism

Virtual reality has proven to be a powerful tool for the world of museums, art and entertainment exhibits, event hosting services, tourism services, and other similar exhibition-focused businesses and services. Virtual reality is a tool to expand real-world establishments' artistic and event offerings. It enables wider audiences to experience arts, exhibits, and otherwise geographically and financially restricted events. As more venues embrace the possibilities of virtual reality, we realize the full potential benefits of virtual reality applied to museums, exhibitions, and tourism spaces.

## Virtual museums, exhibits, and tourism: What it is and how it works

Museums, exhibits, and event hosting services constantly find new ways to implement virtual reality into their showcases. VR allows people worldwide to experience some of the world's most popular museums, art installations, and exhibits without the enormous costs of travel and frequent interruption of crowds often associated with these effort's real-world counterparts. 

Within real-world museums, art installations, and exhibits in the physical world, implementing VR exhibits into their establishments has served to immerse attendees and guests into their hosted experiences, allowing artists and creatives to express their works in new and exciting ways previously unachievable without VR.

## Setting up, deploying, and managing immersive experiences for museums, exhibits, and tourism

### What solutions does the Windows Mixed Reality platform have to assist with configuring virtual play spaces for immersive experiences for museums, exhibits, and tourism?

Many VR experiences require setting up a play space to use them safely. Play spaces are designated real-world spaces that have been cleared of obstacles and deemed safe to use VR in, corresponding to the player's location in virtual space to prevent them from colliding with anything in the real world. For guidance on setting up simple room boundaries up to 5mx5m, see the [set up your room boundary](set-up-windows-mixed-reality.md#set-up-your-room-boundary) documentation. For guidance on setting up larger and more complex play spaces by utilizing the Spatial Anchors capability in the Windows Holographic API stack, visit the [coordinate systems](/windows/mixed-reality/design/coordinate-systems) documentation.
