# Boundary FAQs

A boundary defines the area you can move around in while wearing your Windows Mixed Reality headset. The boundary looks like a white outline inside mixed reality and appears when you come close to it. 

## Boundary creation

### Why should I create a boundary?

It's important to create a boundary to help you avoid the obstacles you can't see while wearing a headset.

The area inside the boundary should be free of furniture, low-hanging light fixtures, ceiling fans, and so on, so you won't bump into or trip over anything. [Learn about health, safety, and comfort for Windows Mixed Reality headsets](wmr-health-safety-comfort.md).

### How do I create a boundary?

When you first set up your headset, the Mixed Reality Portal setup app takes you through the steps to create a boundary. To create a new boundary at any time:

1. On your desktop, select **Start** > **Mixed Reality Portal**.
1. Select **Menu**.
1. In the Mixed Reality Portal, select **Set up room boundary**.


### What are some guidelines for creating boundaries?

- Don't get too close to a wall or other obstruction when creating a boundary.
- Make sure to hold your headset at waist height and face your computer while you trace the boundary.
- Make sure the sensor isn't blocked and there's enough light.
- The space you're tracing should be larger than 3 square meters.
- The space shouldn't be too large or too complicated. Stick to a simple geometric shape with twists and turns.
- Don't cross back over your own path as you're tracing.
- If you get stuck in a corner, start over.

## Boundary usage

### How do I use a boundary?

When you see a boundary, slow your movements, and avoid crossing the boundary or extending your limbs beyond it.

Make sure anyone else using your headset understands the boundary and how to use it. If you move your headset to a new location, you need to [set up a new boundary](set-up-windows-mixed-reality.md#set-up-your-room-boundary) for the space.

### How can I stop the boundary from being visible?

The boundary appears when you're close to it. If your boundary includes any sections with a narrow or irregular shape, you might end up getting close to it frequently. The boundary might appear more often than you like. Try creating your boundary again using a larger and more regular shape.

1. On your desktop, select **Start** > **Mixed Reality Portal**.
1. Select **Menu**.
1. In the Mixed Reality Portal, select **Set up room boundary**.

### How can I turn off the boundary temporarily?

1. On your desktop, select **Start** > **Mixed Reality Portal**.
1. Select **Menu**.
1. In the Mixed Reality Portal, turn **Boundary** to **Off**. Be sure to stay in one place while the boundary is off.

### What's the difference between "Seated and standing" and "All experiences"?

If you choose **Seated and standing** during headset setup or later, you use your headset without a boundary. You need to stay in one spot when using the headset to avoid physical obstacles and tripping hazards. You can sit down or stand up, but you shouldn't move around. Keep in mind that obstacles might be overhead and around you.

If you choose **All experiences**, you set up a boundary, and can use apps and experiences that work with and without a boundary. Some apps might be designed to work with a boundary. Those apps might not work or provide the same experience if you use them without a boundary.

## Boundary troubleshooting

### Why does the system say it can't find the boundary, and present the setup UI?

The tracking system was unable to recognize your environment. If you're in a new environment, you must [set up a new boundary](set-up-windows-mixed-reality.md#set-up-your-room-boundary).

If you've already set up a boundary for this environment:

- Make sure the room has enough light.
- Make sure you've worn the device and looked around the room. The device must observe your environment to know where it is. The headset won't find your boundary if it's sitting on a desk or table.
- Unplug the device, close Mixed Reality, and plug the device in again.
- If the environment has changed, the device might no longer recognize the environment. Set up a new boundary.

If these steps don't resolve the problem, delete your environment data and set up the boundary again.

### Why does the system ask me to choose "All experiences" or "Seated and standing," when I can see my boundary?

The device is taking too long to find the bounds. You can bypass this message by choosing the option to use a boundary. The system takes you to your Mixed Reality home with your bounds present.

### Why do I often see a message saying "I've lost my bounds"?

The tracking system is having a hard time tracking and identifying your environment. In this state, the device can no longer display your bounds. The headset switches to three degrees of freedom (3DoF) to keep you from bumping into things in the real world until it locates your bounds again. Try the following steps to fix the issue:

1. Make sure that the room has enough light.
1. If you recently redecorated or remodeled the room, rerun setup.
1. Unplug the device, close Mixed Reality, and plug the device in again.
1. Clear your environment data and set up the device again.
1. If the message persists, contact customer support.

### What do I do if a message says my boundary can't be found?

Windows Mixed Reality might have trouble identifying your existing boundary. You can create a new boundary, or you can use your device in **Seated and standing** mode.

### What do I do if a message says "Lost tracking" or "We don't have a boundary for this space"?

Create a new boundary.

1. On your desktop, select **Start** > **Mixed Reality Portal**.
1. Select **Menu**.
1. In the Mixed Reality Portal, select **Set up room boundary**.
