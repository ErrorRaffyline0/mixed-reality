# In-app purchases

HoloLens supports in-app purchases (IAPs), but there's some work to set them up.

To use the in app-purchase functionality:

1. [Create a XAML 2D view](../design/app-views.md) to appear as a slate.
1. [Switch to the XAML view](../design/app-views.md#switching-from-the-immersive-view-back-to-a-keyboard-xaml-view) to activate placement, which leaves the [immersive view](../design/app-views.md#immersive-views).
1. Call the [RequestProductPurchaseAsync](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.store.currentapp.requestproductpurchaseasync#windows-applicationmodel-store-currentapp-requestproductpurchaseasync(system-string)) API:

   `await CurrentApp.RequestProductPurchaseAsync("DurableItemIAPName");`

   The `RequestProductPurchaseAsync` API brings up the stock Windows OS popup that shows the in-app purchase name, description, and price. The user can then choose purchase options.

1. Once the user completes the purchase, present UI that lets the user [switch back to the app's immersive view](../design/app-views.md#switching-from-the-2d-xaml-view-to-the-immersive-view).

Apps that target desktop-based Windows Mixed Reality immersive headsets don't need to manually switch to a XAML view before they call the `RequestProductPurchaseAsync` API.
