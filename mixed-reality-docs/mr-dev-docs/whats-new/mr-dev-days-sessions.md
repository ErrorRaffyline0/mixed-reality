|[The State of Mixed Reality--Where Companies are finding Success](/shows/Mixed-Reality/The-State-of-Mixed-Reality-Where-Companies-are-finding-Success)|Ori Amiga & Matt Fleckenstein|Ultra-low latency edge computing, coupled with AI and mixed reality, is the foundation for the next generation of experiences. By blending the digital and the physical worlds into ubiquitous computing experiences, mixed reality is enabling possibilities we could have only dreamed of previously. This session provides unique insight into the mixed reality market opportunity today and in the future. The session highlights how Microsoft is helping leading enterprises in manufacturing, health care, and retail to harness the power of mixed reality to drive business efficiency and transform customer and employee experiences.|
|[Fireside Chat](https://aka.ms/MRDDFireside)|Alex Kipman & René Schulte|Microsoft MVP, Regional Director, and community member extraordinaire René Schulte stands around a fire and chats about the topics the community is interested in. René gathered questions from the community for about a week, and it was a great conversation.|
|[Designing AR/VR experiences using Microsoft Maquette](/shows/Mixed-Reality/Designing-ARVR-experiences-using-Microsoft-Maquette)|Ricardo Acosta|Designing a phone app or a website has a well-defined workflow. Unfortunately, designing spatial reality experiences can be tricky if you use the same 2D workflow or toolset. Luckily, the Microsoft Maquette app focuses on helping UX designers to design.|
|[MRTK Unity v2 & beyond - How community feedback helped us improve MRTK](/shows/Mixed-Reality/MRTK-Unity-v2-and-beyond-How-community-feedback-helped-us-improve-MRTK)|Bernadette Thalhammer|A talk about how we improved the developer experience by listening to feedback from the community, and how developers can leverage these improvements. Dive into the documentation and unit testing, the new object manipulator component, using the migration window, and explore some code snippets around frequently asked questions from the dev community.|
|[Dark Slope's Unreal Engine plugin for the Azure Kinect DK](/shows/Mixed-Reality/Dark-Slopes-Unreal-Engine-plugin-for-the-Azure-Kinect-DK)|Ben Unsworth - Dark Slope|Learn how Dark Slope uses the Azure Kinect DK and its SDKs to build real-time interactive engagements in Unreal Engine.|
