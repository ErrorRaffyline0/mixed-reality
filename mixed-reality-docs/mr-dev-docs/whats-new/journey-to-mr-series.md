Join April Speight, leader of the Spatial Computing Cloud Advocacy team at Microsoft, for a 10-part video series dedicated to helping you get started with your Mixed Reality development journey. Created for the true beginner in mind, this series is ideal for developers and non-developers alike. Register below to attend an event and take part in live Q&A. You can also access the on-demand post-event recordings here shortly after. 

| Session title | Date | Description|
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Episode 1: Paths into Mixed Reality development | See [on-demand video](/shows/mixed-reality/journey-into-xr-dev-ep1) | Come learn the lay of the land for getting started with XR development. We'll explore programming languages, engine options, device options, low code/no-code solutions, and general advice for getting started. |
| Episode 2: Plan & design your Mixed Reality app | See [on-demand video](/shows/mixed-reality/journey-into-xr-dev-ep2) | So, you have a great idea for an app but now what? Before heading into development, there's a lot to consider to ensure your app experience is well thought out and accessibly sound. Learn techniques and tips on planning and designing your future XR app. |
| Episode 3: Low-code/no-code platforms for AR | See [on-demand video](/shows/mixed-reality/journey-into-xr-dev-ep3) | Did you know that coding isn't a requirement to create augmented reality apps? The number of low-code/no-code platforms for AR development has grown over the past few years - enabling creators of all backgrounds to develop their own AR experiences. Join us to explore various low-code/no-code platforms for AR development, including a demo for Microsoft Power Apps.  |
| Episode 4: Enhance XR Experiences with Azure Cloud Services |	See [on-demand video](/shows/mixed-reality/journey-into-xr-dev-ep4) | Take your XR app to the next level by integrating features such as speech recognition, speech translation, object detection, and even a bot! In this episode, we'll explore prototypes for immersive XR experiences that leverage the power of Azure Cognitive Services.|
| Episode 5: Interactions for AR & VR Development | See [on-demand video](/shows/mixed-reality/journey-into-xr-dev-ep5) |	There are many ways to interact with virtual objects that go beyond using our hands and/or motion controllers. Come learn various input models that can enable you to interact with XR apps including a demo for the Mixed Reality Toolkit. |
| Episode 6: Developing Immersive XR Experiences on the Web |	See [on-demand video](/shows/mixed-reality/journey-into-xr-dev-ep6) |	Developing immersive Web experiences is made possible with various JavaScript frameworks and APIs. Come learn how to create immersive augmented reality and virtual reality experiences on the Web, including a demo for Babylon.js and WebXR. |

What are some of the building blocks of XR? What is a coordinate system? Scene understanding? Room scan visualization? Spatial anchors? In this session, we'll put on our lab coats and set up our lab and provide an introduction to some of the fundamental building blocks so that you can create or design XR applications. |
| Episode 8: 3D Modeling & World Building  |	See [on-demand video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfWmW0hudyw&list=PLlrxD0HtieHg7iAQdchuIls-ATakL9jMZ&index=3&t=3s )  |	Modeling the world and objects surrounding us is made possible with various design tools for both beginners and advance creators.
