# Get started with Mixed Reality

![Virtual hummingbird with human hand](images/01_MixedReality.png)

The mixed reality ecosystem is an emerging landscape of physical and digital interactions, limited only by your imagination. Whether you're an experienced developer or a new convert, we recommend that you begin your mixed reality journey with the resources we've laid out below. There's a lot of new ground to cover, so let's get started! 

## Understand the basics

If you're new to mixed reality, it's important that you start from the bottom and work your way up through its core concepts, experiences, and capabilities. You have several options here: we have a focused Learn module that will get you up to speed quickly, or you can choose to explore the individual journeys we've set up below. Any of these paths will help you set a firm foundation for designing and developing your own ideas in mixed reality.

### What is mixed reality?

![Image that shows one of the things you can do with mixed reality?](images/HLS19_remoteAssistHologram_001.jpg)

Before you dive into application design or development, you need to understand what we mean by mixed reality. This section is designed to get you acquainted with the mixed reality spectrum, including environmental input, perceptual changes, design challenges, and devices. 

|  Concept  |  Outcome  |
| --- | --- |
| [Mixed reality is a spectrum](../discover/mixed-reality.md) | Mixed reality blends the physical with the digital to provide the next evolution in human, computer, and environment interactions |
| [What is a hologram?](../discover/hologram.md) | Our [HoloLens headset](/hololens) lets you view holograms, which are objects made of light and sound that appear in the world around you like real objects. Holograms respond to your gaze, gestures and voice commands, and can interact with real-world surfaces around you |
| [Mixed reality learning overview](mr-learning-overview.md#general-modules) | Try out our curated mixed reality module through Microsoft Learn |
| [Expand your design process](../discover/case-study-expanding-the-design-process-for-mixed-reality.md) | Expand your design mindset with spatial thinking, bodystorming, and acting when creating your immersive experiences  |
