# HoloLens tutorial at ECCV 2018

This article describes the conference session **HoloLens as a tool for computer vision research**, held September 8, 2018 at the [European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2018](https://eccv2018.org).

Microsoft HoloLens is the world’s first self-contained, holographic computer, but it’s also a potent computer vision research device. Application code can access audio and video streams and surface meshes, all in a world coordinate space maintained by HoloLens’ highly accurate head-tracking. This tutorial session featured the new HoloLens *Research Mode* capability.

The tutorial showed how to access the raw head-tracking and depth sensor data streams, and use the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of each stream. The session also demonstrated recent advances in time-of-flight depth-sensing technologies in the Kinect for Azure project.

Session attendees got a good sense of how to use HoloLens for a range of computer vision research tasks. Attendees received materials to help them quickly get started using HoloLens.

The following image shows a sample HoloLens application that displays any of the six Research Mode streams in real time.
