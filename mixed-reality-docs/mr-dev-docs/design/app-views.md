# App views

Windows apps can contain two kinds of views: **immersive views** and **2D views**. Apps can switch between their various immersive and 2D views, showing their 2D views either on a monitor as a window or in a headset as a slate. Apps that have at least one immersive view are categorized as **mixed reality apps**. Apps that never have an immersive view are **2D apps**.

## Overview

### Immersive views

An immersive view gives your app the ability to create holograms in the world around you or immerse the user in a virtual environment. When an app is drawing in the immersive view, no other app is drawing at the same time&mdash;holograms from multiple apps aren't composited together. By continually adjusting the perspective from which your [app renders](../develop/advanced-concepts/rendering-overview.md) its scene to match the user's head movements, your app can render [world-locked](coordinate-systems.md) holograms. World-locked holograms stay at a fixed point in the real world or can render a virtual world that holds its position as a user moves.

*When in an immersive view, holograms can be placed in the world around you*

On [HoloLens](/hololens/hololens1-hardware), your app renders its holograms on top of the user's real-world surroundings. On a [Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset](/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/immersive-headset-hardware-details), the user can't see the real world, and so your app must render everything the user will see.

The [Windows Mixed Reality home](../discover/navigating-the-windows-mixed-reality-home.md) (including the Start menu and holograms you've placed around the environment) doesn't render while in an immersive view either. On HoloLens, Cortana relays any system notifications that occur while an immersive view is showing, to which the user can respond with voice input.

While in an immersive view, your app is also responsible for handling all input. Input in Windows Mixed Reality is made up of [gaze](gaze-and-commit.md), [gesture](gaze-and-commit.md#composite-gestures) (HoloLens only), [voice, and [motion controllers](motion-controllers.md) (immersive headsets only).

### 2D views

![Multiple 2D views laid out around the Windows Mixed Reality home](images/teleportation-940px.png)<br>
*Multiple apps with a 2D view placed around the Windows Mixed Reality home*

An app with a 2D view appears in the [Windows Mixed Reality home](../discover/navigating-the-windows-mixed-reality-home.md) (sometimes called the "shell") as a virtual slate, rendered alongside the app launchers and other holograms the user has placed in their world. The user can adjust this slate to move and scale it, though it remains at a fixed resolution whatever its size. If your app's first view is a 2D view, your 2D content will fill the same slate used to launch the app.

In a desktop headset, you can run any Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps that run on your desktop monitor today. These apps are already rendering 2D views today, and their content will automatically appear on a slate in the user's world when launched. 2D UWP apps can target the **Windows.Universal** device family to run on both desktop headsets and on HoloLens as slates.

One key use of 2D views is showing a text entry form that uses the system keyboard. Because the shell can't render on top of an immersive view, the app has to switch to a 2D view to show the system keyboard. Apps that want to accept text input need to switch to a 2D view with a text box. While that text box has focus, the system will show the system keyboard, allowing the user to enter text.

An app can have 2D views on both the desktop monitor and in an attached headset on a desktop PC. For example, you can browse Edge on your desktop monitor using its main 2D view to find a 360-degree video. When you play that video, Edge will launch a secondary immersive view inside the headset to display the immersive video content.

## Choosing a view

When your app activates, you can choose what type of view you'd like to display. For an app's **CoreApplication**, there's always a primary [app view](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ApplicationView) and any number of further app views you would like to create. On desktop, you can think of an app view as a window. Our mixed reality app templates create a Unity project where the primary app view is [immersive](app-views.md). 

Your app can create an extra 2D app view using technology like XAML, to use Windows 10 features such as in-app purchase. If your app started as a UWP app for other Windows 10 devices, your primary view is 2D. However, you can "light up" in mixed reality by adding another app view that's immersive to show an experience volumetrically. Imagine building a photo viewer app in XAML where the slideshow button switched to an immersive app view that flew photos from the app across the world and surfaces.

![The running app can have a 2D view or an immersive view](images/slide3-800px.png)<br>
*The running app can have a 2D view or an immersive view*

## Creating an immersive view

Mixed reality apps create an immersive view, which is achieved with the [HolographicSpace](/uwp/api/windows.graphics.holographic.holographicspace) type.

An app that is purely immersive should always create an immersive view on launch, even if launched from the desktop. Immersive views always show up in the headset, regardless of where they were created from. Activating an immersive view will display the Mixed Reality Portal and guide the user to put on their headset.

An app that starts with a 2D view on the desktop monitor may create a secondary immersive view to show content in the headset. An example of this is a 2D Edge window on the monitor displaying a 360-degree video in the headset.

![Apps running in immersive view are the only one visible](images/slide4-800px.png)<br>
*An app running in an immersive view is the only one visible*

## 2D view in the Windows Mixed Reality home

Anything other than an immersive view is rendered as a 2D view in your world.

An app may have 2D views on both the desktop monitor and in the headset. A new 2D view will be placed in the same shell as the view that created it, either on the monitor or in the headset. It isn't currently possible for an app or a user to move a 2D view between the Mixed Reality home and the monitor.

![Apps running in 2D view share the space in the mixed world with other apps](images/slide5-800px.png)<br>
*Apps running in a 2D view share the space with other apps*

## Placement of additional app tiles

You can place as many apps with a 2D view in your world as you want with the [Secondary Tile APIs](/windows/uwp/design/shell/tiles-and-notifications/secondary-tiles). These "pinned" tiles will appear as splash screens that users must place and then can later use to launch your app. Windows Mixed Reality doesn't currently support rendering any of the 2D tile content as live tiles.

![Apps can have multiple placements using secondary tiles](images/slide6-800px.png)<br>

## Switching views

### Switching from the 2D XAML view to the immersive view

If the app uses XAML, then the XAML [IFrameworkViewSource](/uwp/api/windows.applicationmodel.core.iframeworkviewsource) will control the first view of the app. The app will need to switch to the immersive view before activating the **CoreWindow**, to ensure the app launches directly into the immersive experience.

Use [CoreApplication.CreateNewView](/uwp/api/Windows.ApplicationModel.Core.CoreApplication#Windows_ApplicationModel_Core_CoreApplication_CreateNewView_Windows_ApplicationModel_Core_IFrameworkViewSource_) and [ApplicationViewSwitcher.SwitchAsync](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ApplicationViewSwitcher#Windows_UI_ViewManagement_ApplicationViewSwitcher_SwitchAsync_System_Int32_) to make it the active view.

> [!NOTE]
>* Do not specify the [ApplicationViewSwitchingOptions.ConsolidateViews](/uwp/api/windows.ui.viewmanagement.applicationviewswitchingoptions) flag to **SwitchAsync** when switching from the XAML view to the immersive view, or the slate that launched the app will be removed from the world.
>* **SwitchAsync** should be called using the [Dispatcher](/uwp/api/windows.ui.core.corewindow#Windows_UI_Core_CoreWindow_Dispatcher) associated with the view you are switching into.
>* You will need to **SwitchAsync** back to the XAML view if you need to launch a virtual keyboard or want to activate another app.

![Apps can switch between 2D views and immersive views](images/slide7-600px.png) ![When an app goes into an immersive view, the mixed world and other apps disappear](images/slide8-600px.png)<br>
*Left: apps can switch between 2D view and immersive view. Right: when an app goes into an immersive view, the Windows Mixed Reality home and other apps disappear.*

### Switching from the immersive view back to a keyboard XAML view

One common reason for switching back-and-forth between views is displaying a keyboard in a mixed reality app. The shell is only able to display the system keyboard if the app is showing a 2D view. If the app needs to get text input, it may provide a custom XAML view with a text input field, switch to it, and then switch back after the input is complete.

Like in the previous section, you can use **ApplicationViewSwitcher.SwitchAsync** to transition back to a XAML view from your immersive view.

## App size

2D app views always appear in a fixed virtual slate. This makes all 2D views show the exact same amount of content. Here are some further details about the size of your app's 2D view:
* The aspect ratio of the app is preserved while resizing.
* App [resolution and scale factor](../develop/porting-apps/building-2d-apps.md#2d-app-view-resolution-and-scale-factor) aren't changed by resizing.
* Apps aren't able to query their actual size in the world.

![2D apps appear with fixed window sizes](images/12493521-10104043956964683-6118765685995662420-o-500px.jpg)<br>

## App tiles

The Start menu uses the standard small tile and medium tile for pins and the **All Apps** list in mixed reality.

## App to app interactions

As you build apps, you have access to the rich app to app communication mechanisms available on Windows 10. Many of the new Protocol APIs and file registrations work perfectly on HoloLens to enable app launching and communication. 

For desktop headsets, the app associated with a given file extension or protocol may be a Win32 app that can only appear on the desktop monitor or in the desktop slate.

## Protocols

HoloLens supports app to app launching via the [Windows.System.Launcher APIs](/uwp/api/Windows.System.Launcher).

There are some things to consider when launching another application:

* When doing a non-modal launch, such as [LaunchUriAsync](/uwp/api/Windows.System.Launcher#Windows_System_Launcher_LaunchUriAsync_Windows_Foundation_Uri_), the user must place the app before interacting with it.

* When doing a modal launch, such as through [LaunchUriForResultsAsync](/uwp/api/Windows.System.Launcher#Windows_System_Launcher_LaunchUriForResultsAsync_Windows_Foundation_Uri_Windows_System_LauncherOptions_Windows_Foundation_Collections_ValueSet_), the modal app is placed on top of the window.

* Windows Mixed Reality can't overlay applications on top of exclusive views. To show the launched app, Windows takes the user back to the world to display the application.

## File pickers

HoloLens supports both [FileOpenPicker](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker) and [FileSavePicker](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileSavePicker) contracts. However, no app comes pre-installed that fulfills the file picker contracts. These apps - OneDrive, for example - can be installed from the Microsoft Store.

If you have more than one file picker app installed, you won't see any disambiguation UI for choosing which app to launch. Instead, the first file picker installed will be chosen. When saving a file, the filename is generated which includes the timestamp. This cannot be changed by the user.

By default, the following extensions are supported locally:

|  App  |  Extensions | 
|----------|----------|
|  Photos  |  bmp, gif, jpg, png, avi, mov, mp4, wmv | 
|  Microsoft Edge  |  htm, html, pdf, svg, xml | 

## App contracts and Windows Mixed Reality extensions

App contracts and extension points allow you to register your app to take advantage of deeper operating system features like handling a file extension or using background tasks. This is a list of the supported and unsupported contracts and extension points on HoloLens.

## App file storage

All storage is through the [Windows.Storage namespace](/uwp/api/Windows.Storage). HoloLens doesn't support app storage sync/roaming. For more information, check out the documentation below:

* [Files, folders, and libraries](/windows/uwp/files/index)
* [Store and retrieve settings and other app data](/windows/uwp/design/app-settings/store-and-retrieve-app-data)

## App package

With Windows 10, you no longer target an operating system but instead [target your app to one or more device families](/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide#device-families). A device family identifies the APIs, system characteristics, and behaviors that you can expect across devices within the device family. It also determines the set of devices on which your app can be installed from the [Microsoft Store](../distribute/submitting-an-app-to-the-microsoft-store.md#specifying-target-device-families).

* To target both desktop headsets and HoloLens, target your app to the **Windows. Universal** device family.
* To target just desktop headsets, target your app to the **Windows.Desktop** device family.
* To target just HoloLens, target your app to the **Windows.Holographic** device family.
