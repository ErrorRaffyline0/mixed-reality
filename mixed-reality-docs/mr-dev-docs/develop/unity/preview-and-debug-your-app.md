# Preview and debug your app using Holographic Remoting and Play mode

This article explains the following use case for Holographic Remoting: 

- **You want to preview and debug your app during the development process**: You can run your app locally in the Unity editor on your PC in Play Mode and stream the experience to your HoloLens. This provides a way to quickly debug your app without building and deploying a full project. We call this type of app a _Holographic Remoting Play Mode Preview app_. Inputs from the HoloLens--gaze, gesture, voice, and spatial mapping--are sent to the PC, where content is rendered in a virtual immersive view. The rendered frames are then sent to the HoloLens. 

To learn more about Holographic Remoting, see [Holographic Remoting Overview](../native/holographic-remoting-overview.md)

Note that you can also use Holographic Remoting if [you want the resources of a PC to power your app](use-pc-resources.md) instead of relying on the HoloLens on-board resources.

## Set up Holographic Remoting

To use Holographic Remoting, you need to install the [Holographic Remoting Player](../native/holographic-remoting-player.md) app from the Microsoft Store on your HoloLens (in this article, we'll refer to it simply as "the Player"). As explained below, after you download and run the app, you'll see the version number and IP address to connect to. **You'll need v2.4 or later in order to work with the OpenXR plugin**.

Holographic Remoting requires a fast PC and Wi-Fi connection. You can find more details in the Holographic Remoting Player article linked above.

# [Unity 2021/2022 + OpenXR](#tab/openxr)

The following steps assume that you have already set up your project to use OpenXR (in other words, you've imported the required packages and chosen settings for the OpenXR plug-in). If you haven't yet done this, see our articles describing how to set up a new OpenXR project [with MRTK](./new-openxr-project-with-mrtk.md) or [without MRTK](./new-openxr-project-without-mrtk.md).

1. On your HoloLens 2, go to the **Microsoft Store** and install the [Player](https://www.microsoft.com/store/p/holographic-remoting-player/9nblggh4sv40)**.
1. On your HoloLens 2, launch and play the Player. Note that on the Start menu, the tile for the Player says **Holographic Remoting**. After launching the Player, make sure to press the "Play" button which appears in the middle of the Player's interface. 
1. In Unity, on the menu bar, select **Mixed Reality** > **Remoting** > **Holographic remoting for play mode**.

> [!TIP]
> For best results, make sure your app properly sets the [../focus point](focus-point-in-unity.md). This helps Holographic Remoting to best adapt your scene to the latency of your wireless connection.
