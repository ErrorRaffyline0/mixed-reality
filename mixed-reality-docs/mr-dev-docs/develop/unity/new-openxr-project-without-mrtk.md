# Set up a new OpenXR project without MRTK

You're now ready to begin developing with OpenXR in Unity!

### Unity sample projects

Check out the [OpenXR Mixed Reality samples repo](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenXR-Unity-MixedReality-Samples) for sample unity projects showcasing how to build Unity applications for HoloLens 2 or Mixed Reality headsets using the Mixed Reality OpenXR plugin.
