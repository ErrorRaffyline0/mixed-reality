# [World Locking Tools (Recommended)](#tab/wlt)

By default, World Locking Tools restore Unity's coordinate system relative to the physical world across sessions on devices that support persistence of local spatial anchors. To have a hologram appear in the same place in the physical world after quitting and rerunning the application, the application only needs to restore the same pose to the hologram.

If the application needs finer control, you can disable **Auto-Save** and **Auto-Load** in the inspector, and manage persistence from a script. For more information, see [Persist spatial coordinate systems](/mixed-reality/world-locking-tools/documentation/concepts/advanced/persistence).

World Locking Tools supports local anchor persistence only on HoloLens devices. For Android, iOS, and HoloLens devices, integrate with Azure Spatial Anchors to support persistence and sharing of coordinate spaces across sessions and devices. For more information and samples using World Locking Tools with Azure Spatial Anchors, see [World Locking Tools (WLT) combined with Azure Spatial Anchors (ASA)](/mixed-reality/world-locking-tools/documentation/howtos/wlt_asa).

# [ARAnchorManager](#tab/anchorstore)

An API called the `XRAnchorStore` enables anchors to be persisted between sessions. The `XRAnchorStore` is a representation of the saved anchors on a device. You can persist anchors from `ARAnchors` in the Unity scene, load anchors from storage into new `ARAnchors`, or delete anchors from storage.

> [!NOTE]
> You save and load these anchors on the same device. Cross-device anchors are supported through [Azure Spatial Anchors](../../shared-experiences-in-unity.md#azure-spatial-anchors).

### Namespaces

For **Unity 2020 and OpenXR**:

```cs
using Microsoft.MixedReality.ARSubsystems.XRAnchorStore
```

or **Unity 2019/2020 + Windows XR Plugin**:

```cs
using UnityEngine.XR.WindowsMR.XRAnchorStore
```

### Public methods

```cs
{
    // A list of all persisted anchors, which can be loaded.
    public IReadOnlyList<string> PersistedAnchorNames { get; }

    // Clear all persisted anchors
    public void Clear();

    // Load a single persisted anchor by name. The ARAnchorManager will create this new anchor and report it in
    // the ARAnchorManager.anchorsChanged event. The TrackableId returned here is the same TrackableId the
    // ARAnchor will have when it is instantiated.
    public TrackableId LoadAnchor(string name);

    // Attempts to persist an existing ARAnchor with the given TrackableId to the local store. Returns true if
    // the storage is successful, false otherwise.
    public bool TryPersistAnchor(TrackableId id, string name);

    // Removes a single persisted anchor from the anchor store. This will not affect any ARAnchors in the Unity
    // scene, only the anchors in storage.
    public void UnpersistAnchor(string name);
}
```

### Get an anchor store reference

To load the XRAnchorStore with **Unity 2020 and OpenXR**, use extension method on the XRAnchorSubsystem, the subsystem of an ARAnchorManager:

``` cs
public static Task<XRAnchorStore> LoadAnchorStoreAsync(this XRAnchorSubsystem anchorSubsystem)
```

To load the XRAnchorStore with **Unity 2019/2020 and the Windows XR Plugin**, use the extension method on the XRReferencePointSubsystem (Unity 2019) or XRAnchorSubsystem (Unity 2020), the subsystem of an ARReferencePointManager/ARAnchorManager:

```cs
// Unity 2019 + Windows XR Plugin
public static Task<XRAnchorStore> TryGetAnchorStoreAsync(this XRReferencePointSubsystem anchorSubsystem);

// Unity 2020 + Windows XR Plugin
public static Task<XRAnchorStore> TryGetAnchorStoreAsync(this XRAnchorSubsystem anchorSubsystem);
```

### Load an anchor store

To load an anchor store in **Unity 2020 and OpenXR**, access it from an ARAnchorManager's subsystem as follows:

``` cs
ARAnchorManager arAnchorManager = GetComponent<ARAnchorManager>();
XRAnchorStore anchorStore = await arAnchorManager.subsystem.LoadAnchorStoreAsync();
```

or with **Unity 2019/2020 and the Windows XR Plugin**:

``` cs
// Unity 2019
ARReferencePointManager arReferencePointManager = GetComponent<ARReferencePointManager>();
XRAnchorStore anchorStore = await arReferencePointManager.subsystem.TryGetAnchorStoreAsync();

// Unity 2020
ARAnchorManager arAnchorManager = GetComponent<ARAnchorManager>();
XRAnchorStore anchorStore = await arAnchorManager.subsystem.TryGetAnchorStoreAsync();
```

# [WorldAnchor](#tab/worldanchor)

For hologram persistence in older Unity versions or WSA projects, use **WorldAnchor**.

**Namespace:** *UnityEngine.XR.WSA.Persistence*<br>
**Class:** *WorldAnchorStore*

The **WorldAnchorStore** creates holographic experiences where holograms stay in specific real world positions across instances of the application. Users can pin individual holograms wherever they want, and find them later in the same spot over app sessions.

The `WorldAnchorStore` lets you persist the location of world anchors across sessions. To persist holograms across sessions, keep separate track of `GameObjects` that use a particular world anchor. You can create a `GameObject` root with a world anchor, and anchor child holograms by it with a local position offset.

To load holograms from previous sessions:

1. Get the `WorldAnchorStore`.
2. Load world anchor app data, which gives you the ID of the world anchor.
3. Load the world anchor by its ID.

To save holograms for future sessions:

1. Get the `WorldAnchorStore`.
2. Save a world anchor, specifying an ID.
3. Save app data related to the world anchor along with the ID.

### Get the WorldAnchorStore

Keep a reference to the `WorldAnchorStore`, so you know when it's ready to perform an operation. Since this call is asynchronous, as soon as the app starts up you can call:

```cs
WorldAnchorStore.GetAsync(StoreLoaded);
```

`StoreLoaded` is the handler when the `WorldAnchorStore` finishes loading:

```cs
private void StoreLoaded(WorldAnchorStore store)
{
       this.store = store;
}
```

You now have a reference to the `WorldAnchorStore`, which you can use to save and load specific world anchors.

### Save a world anchor

To save a world anchor, name the world anchor and pass it in the `WorldAnchorStore` you got before. If you try to save two anchors to the same string, `store.Save` returns false. Delete the previous save before saving a new one.

```cs
private void SaveGame()
{
       // Save data about holograms that this world anchor positions
       if (!this.savedRoot) // Only save the root once
       {
              this.savedRoot = this.store.Save("rootGameObject", anchor);
              Assert(this.savedRoot);
       }
}
```

### Load a world anchor

To load a world anchor:

```cs
private void LoadGame()
{
       // Saved data about holograms that this world anchor positions:
       this.savedRoot = this.store.Load("rootGameObject", rootGameObject);
       if (!this.savedRoot)
       {
              // Game root not saved. Re-place objects or start over.
       }
}
```

You can also use `store.Delete()` to remove an anchor you previously saved, and `store.Clear()` to remove all previously saved data.

### Enumerate existing anchors

To list stored anchors, call `GetAllIds`.

```cs
string[] ids = this.store.GetAllIds();
for (int index = 0; index < ids.Length; index++)
{
        Debug.Log(ids[index]);
}
```

## Persist holograms for multiple devices

You can use [Azure Spatial Anchors](/azure/spatial-anchors/overview) to create a durable cloud anchor from a local world anchor. Your app can locate the cloud anchor across multiple HoloLens, iOS, and Android devices, even if the devices aren't together at the same time. Because cloud anchors are persistent, multiple devices can see content rendered relative to that anchor in the same physical location over time.
