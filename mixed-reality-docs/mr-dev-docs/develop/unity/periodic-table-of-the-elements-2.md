# Periodic Table of the Elements 2.0

>[!NOTE]
>This article discusses an exploratory sample weâ€™ve created in the [Mixed Reality Design Labs](https://github.com/Microsoft/MRDesignLabs_Unity), a place where we share our learnings about and suggestions for mixed reality app development. Our design-related articles and code will evolve as we make new discoveries.

[Periodic Table of the Elements](https://github.com/Microsoft/MRDesignLabs_Unity_PeriodicTable) is an open-source sample app from Microsoft's Mixed Reality Design Labs. The app was originally designed for HoloLens 1st generation and immersive headset back in 2015 to demonstrate how to create an end-to-end experience using MRTK's building blocks. To fully leverage new articulated hand tracking and eye tracking input on HoloLens 2, the app has been updated using MRTK v2.
