# Holographic Remoting System Requirements

This chapter lists the minimum system requirements to work with Holographic Remoting.

## Remote PC

- Windows 10 version 1903 or higher or Windows 11.
- Up-to-date graphics drivers.
- GPU with H264 video **encode** support.
- Optional: GPU with H265 video **encode** support.

## Player PC

- Windows 10 version 1903 or higher or Windows 11.
- Up-to-date graphics drivers.
- GPU with H264 video **decode** support.
- Optional: GPU with H265 video **decode** support.

> [!NOTE]
> The player PC requirements are only relevant if your player application runs on a Windows PC with Windows Mixed Reality instead of the HoloLens 2.

The table below helps to find which GPUs support hardware video encoding and decoding:

|GPU manufacturer|Supported models|
|----------------|----------------|
|NVIDIA|Check the support matrix [at the bottom of this page](https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-decode-gpu-support-matrix)|
|AMD|Check the support matrix [on this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Video_Decoder#UVD_6)|
|Intel|Skylake and newer CPUs|

Even though the correct H265 codec might be installed, security properties on the codec DLLs may cause codec initialization failures. The [troubleshooting](holographic-remoting-troubleshooting.md) section describes steps on how to solve this problem.

> [!Important]
> Windows update doesn't always deliver the very latest GPU drivers. Check your GPU manufacturer's website for latest drivers:
> - [**AMD drivers**](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
> - [**Intel drivers**](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html)
> - [**NVIDIA drivers**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)

## Network

A stable, low-latency network connection between the player and remote is critical for a good user experience.

## Software

The following software must be installed on a developer PC:

- The latest version of Visual Studio 2022 [download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)
  - Workloads:
    - Desktop development with C++
