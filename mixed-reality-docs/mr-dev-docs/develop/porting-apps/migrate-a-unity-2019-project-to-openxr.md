# Migrate a Unity 2019 project to Unity 2020 + OpenXR

For the smoothest migration, we recommend that you complete all the steps in this article in the order presented. Here's an overview of the major steps:

1. Update MRTK to the latest stable version.
1. Move your project to Unity 2019 XR Plug-in Management.
1. Choose "Windows Mixed Reality."
1. Upgrade to Unity 2020.3 LTS.
1. Use the Mixed Reality Feature Tool to install more packages.
1. Configure XR Plugin Management for OpenXR.

## 1. Update MRTK to the latest stable version

If you’re already using MRTK, we suggest that the first step in your migration should be to run the Mixed Reality Feature Tool and update to the latest stable version of MRTK.

### Select the features you want

> [!NOTE]
> The descriptions and images in this section are based on the most recent version of the Tool. If the instructions don't match what you're seeing, check to ensure that you're not using an older version of the Tool.

1. Open the Microsoft Mixed Reality Feature Tool and then click the **Start** button.

    :::image type="content" source="images/001-mr-feature-tool.png" alt-text="Mixed Reality Feature Tool":::

1. Select the Browse button (it's the "three-dot" button in the image below), then navigate to your project, and then open it.

    :::image type="content" source="images/002-open-your-project.png" alt-text="Open your project":::

1. Select **Discover Features.**

    **Note**: You may need to wait a few seconds while the Tool refreshes the packages from the feeds.

1. On the **Discover Features** page, note that there is a list of six package groups.

    :::image type="content" source="images/003-mrft-groups.png" alt-text="The main groups of packages in the Mixed Reality Feature Tool":::

1. Click the "+" button to the left of **Mixed Reality Toolkit** and then select the latest version of **Mixed Reality Toolkit Foundation**.

### Import the features

1. After you've made your selection(s), click **Get Features**. 
1. On the **Import Features** page, the left-side column, **Features**, displays the packages you just selected. The right-side column, **Required dependencies**, displays any dependencies. You can click the **Details** link for any of these items to learn more about them.
1. When you're ready to move on, select **Import.** On the **Review and Approve** page, you can review information about the packages.
1. Select **Approve.** The Feature Tool displays a message that says your project has been updated.
1. Return to the Unity Editor and click a blank area in the UI. You'll see a message telling you that your packages are being imported.

By doing this upgrade while still using Unity 2019, you can view the MRTK Project Configurator and see any "deprecated API" warnings about how to get current. The warnings will tell you what to change. If you don't do this MRTK upgrade first, the old API might be gone and you won’t have those warnings.

## 2. Move your project to Unity 2019 XR Plug-in Management

After you've updated MRTK, you can instruct Unity 2019 to use XR Plug-in Management.

1. In the Unity editor on the menu bar, select **Edit** > **Project Settings**.
1. In the left side column of the **Project Settings** window, select **XR Plugin Management**.

As this point, you might see a button labeled **Install XR Plugin Management** button. If so, continue on with the steps below. If you already have the XR management system installed, you can skip the rest of the steps in this section and continue on to the next section, "Choose 'Windows Mixed Reality'."

1. Click the **Install XR Plugin Management** button.
1. A dialog named **Built in VR Detected** appears and asks if you want to remove the built-in VR package. Click **Ok**.

    :::image type="content" source="images/002-built-in-vr.png" alt-text="Message about Built-in VR being detected.":::

1. The **Built in VR Enabled** dialog box appears. Click **Ok**. This disables built-in VR.
1. The **MRTK Project Configurator** window appears and requests that you enable an XR pipeline. Select the second option, **XR SDK/SR Management**.
1. On the next page in the Configurator, click **Show Settings**.

## 3. Choose "Windows Mixed Reality"

We're not quite ready to install OpenXR yet, but this next set of steps helps you to get clean on any APIs that were only available and supported on the “Built-in XR” path. (If you’re using MRTK, most of this is abstracted for you.)

1. In the Unity Editor **Project Settings** window, ensure that you're on the **XR Plug-in Management** page.
1. Do one of the following:
    - **If you're targeting the HoloLens 2:**  
    Ensure that you're in the Universal Windows Platform tab (it's the second tab and displays the Windows logo) and then, under **Plug-in-Providers**, select **Windows Mixed Reality.**
    - **If you're targeting Desktop VR:**  
    Ensure that you're in the Desktop tab (it's the first tab and displays an image of a monitor), and then, under **Plug-in-Providers**, select **Windows Mixed Reality.**
1. The **MRTK Project Configurator** window appears again. Click the **Next** button, and then click **Next** again. (You may want to take a moment to read the explanations on these pages before moving on.)
1. Select **Import TMP Essentials**.
1. Select **Done**. This closes the Configurator.
1. Close the **Project Settings** window, save your project, and then exit Unity.

> [!NOTE]
> When you use XR Plug-in Management in Unity 2019, Azure Spatial Anchors (ASA) isn't supported. If your project has ASA code, you won’t be able to test it until after you've installed Unity 2020. Otherwise, you should be able to validate your app at this stage.

## 4. Upgrade to Unity 2020.3 LTS

1. Install the [latest LTS patch release](../unity/choosing-unity-version.md) of Unity 2020.3.
1. Open your Unity 2019 project in Unity 2020.3.

You’ll see a dialog asking if you want to upgrade your project to a newer version of Unity. Click **CONFIRM**.

If you were previously using AR Foundation 2.0, the project will move you forward automatically to AR Foundation 4.0.

## 5. Use the Mixed Reality Feature Tool to install more packages

Use the Mixed Reality Feature Tool to import the packages below.

1. If you’re using ASA, open the **Azure Mixed Reality Services** drop-down and select the latest version of **Azure Spatial Anchors SDK Core** and **Azure Spatial Anchors SDK for Windows**.
1. Open the **Platform Support** drop-down and select the latest version of **Mixed Reality OpenXR Plugin.**
1. After the packages load, a **Warning** dialog appears asking if you want to restart the Unity editor in order to enable backends. Select **Yes.**
1. When Unity reopens, the **MRTK Project Configurator** appears. Take a moment to read the explanations in the window, and then select **Apply**.
1. A dialog appears stating that Unity must be restarted for the input system to take effect. Select **Apply**.

## 6. Configure XR Plugin Management for OpenXR

After Unity reopens again, you can set OpenXR as the runtime:

1. On the menu bar, select **Edit** > **Project Settings**.

    Look in the left-side column and ensure that you're on the **XR Plug-in Management** page and in the Universal Windows Platform tab (there's an image of the Windows logo on the tab).

1. In the **Plug-in Providers** list, select **OpenXR**.

    :::image type="content" source="images/010-plug-in-management.png" alt-text="Plug-in management":::

1. In the same section, select **Microsoft HoloLens feature group.**
1. Note that there's now a yellow warning triangle next to **OpenXR**. Hover your cursor over the triangle, then read the message in the popup, and then select the triangle.

    :::image type="content" source="images/011-warning-msg.png" alt-text="OpenXR warning message":::

1. In the **OpenXR Project Validation** window, there are several  issues listed. Select the **Fix All** button.

    :::image type="content" source="images/012-lock-input-fix.png" alt-text="Project Validation window":::

1. One issue remains and tells you that you must add at least one interaction profile. To do so, click **Edit.** This takes you to the settings for the **OpenXR** plugin in the **Project Settings** window.

    :::image type="content" source="images/013-openxr-features.png" alt-text="OpenXR Plugin settings":::

1. Select the plus sign (+) button three times, each time choosing a different profile:

    :::image type="content" source="images/022-add-profile-button.png" alt-text="Add Profiles plus-sign button":::

    **Eye Gaze Interaction Profile**

    **Microsoft Hand Interaction Profile**

    **Microsoft Motion Controller Profile**

    :::image type="content" source="images/014-profiles.png" alt-text="Interaction profiles":::

    If the **Eye Gaze Interaction Profile**, or any other profile, appears with a yellow triangle next to it, select the triangle, and then in the **OpenXR Project Validation** window, click the **Fix** button.

    :::image type="content" source="images/014B-fix-eye-gaze-profile.png" alt-text="Eye gaze interaction profiles":::

1. In the **OpenXR Feature Groups** section, select **Microsoft HoloLens**, and then select **Hand Tracking** and **Motion Controller Model** if they're not already selected.

    :::image type="content" source="images/015-features-selected.png" alt-text="OpenXR feature groups":::

1. Click the **Depth Submission Mode** drop down and then select **Depth 16 Bit**.

    :::image type="content" source="images/017-depth-sixteen-bit.png" alt-text="Debpth submission mode":::

1. Close the **Project Settings** window and any other windows that are still open.

Your project is now fully migrated.
