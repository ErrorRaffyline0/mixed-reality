# [Unity](#tab/unity)

The open-source sample apps were created by our teams to help you get a handle on Mixed Reality development first-hand. We've provided the projects and full source code as a learning reference.

### HoloLens 2 open-source sample apps

These sample apps are made with the Mixed Reality Toolkit for Unity.

* [Galaxy Explorer 1.0](../unity/galaxy-explorer.md)
* [Lunar Module](../unity/lunar-module.md)

# [Unreal](#tab/unreal)

Most of the open-source sample apps made by our team can be found in the Unreal mixed reality samples [repository](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-Unreal-Samples) on GitHub. We've provided the source code so that developers can look at, learn from, and reuse our projects.
