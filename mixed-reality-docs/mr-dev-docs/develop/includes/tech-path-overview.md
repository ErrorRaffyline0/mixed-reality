Create mixed reality apps with a direct line to the Windows Mixed Reality APIs. The Windows Mixed Reality API supports applications written in C++ and C#, allowing you to build your own framework or middleware in either language.

OpenXR is an open royalty-free API standard from Khronos that provides engines native access to a wide range of devices from vendors across the mixed reality spectrum.

You can develop using OpenXR on a HoloLens 2 or Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset on the desktop. If you don't have access to a headset, emulators for HoloLens 2 and Windows Mixed Reality headsets are available.
