# Setting up your development environment

Before setting up a Unity Project with MRTK3, make sure you have the following prerequisites

- A Windows 10 or 11 PC
- Visual Studio 2022 with the required workloads (as noted in the [Installation Checklist](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/install-the-tools?tabs=unity))
- Windows 10 SDK 10.0.18362.0 or later
- Unity Hub with Unity 2021.3 LTS installed

If your target platform is a HoloLens device, your unity installation will need to include the Universal Windows Platform Support Module
