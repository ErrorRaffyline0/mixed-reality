# Extended Assets &#8212; MRTK3

The extended assets package builds upon the standard assets and provides additional materials, fonts, audio files and other assets that are used by the MRTK example scenes. These assets can be freely used in your projects as temporary or final art.

## Audio

The audio folder contains the files used by the hand interaction example scene's piano keyboard. Piano and Xylophone note samples are both included.

## Fonts

The open source [Selawik font](/typography/font-list/selawik) is included in the fonts folder. This font is an open source replacement for the Segoe UI font.

Also included, in the FontsSDF folder, are Selawik assets for Text Mesh Pro.

## Models

An assortment of 3D models, such as a coffee cup, that are used in the examples scenes are provided in the models folder. 

The materials and textures used with these models can be found in their respective folders.
