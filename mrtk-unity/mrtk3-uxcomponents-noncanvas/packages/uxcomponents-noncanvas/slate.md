# Slate &#8212; MRTK3

![Slate](../../../mrtk3-overview/images/UXBuildingBlocks/MRTK_UX_v3_Slate.png)

[!INCLUDE[](includes/canvas-reminder.md)]

The non-Canvas Slate prefab offers a thin window-style control for displaying 2D content, such as plain text and images. It offers a grabbable title bar and *Close* functionality. When building Canvas layouts, consider using a Canvas rounded rect directly as part of your layout.

For smaller, simpler collections of UI, consider using a [near menu](../../../mrtk3-uxcomponents/packages/uxcomponents/near-menu.md) instead.
