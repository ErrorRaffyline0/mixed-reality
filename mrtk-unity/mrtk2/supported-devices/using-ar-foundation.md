> [!NOTE]
> This installation checks (when the application starts) if the AR Foundation components are in the scene. If not, they are automatically added to make it work with ARCore and ARKit.
> If you need to set a specific behaviour, you should add the components you need by yourself.
> For more information about AR Foundation components and installation, check this [documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@2.2/manual/index.html#samples).
